          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Sterk is a fitness tracking app designed to help users log and
            analyze their workouts. The app is provided for personal use only.
            Commercial use, including offering the app as part of a paid service
            or incorporating it into a business, is prohibited without prior
            written consent.

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Sterk stores data locally on your device. Additionally, Sterk
            collects anonymous analytics data via Posthog to monitor performance
            and improve the app. It is your responsibility to back up or manage
            your locally stored data. Sterk recommends using regular device
            backups to avoid data loss.
